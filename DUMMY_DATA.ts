      '<p>Version 1.5 is all about software architecture improvements. imc Express is now able to process all your requirements even faster. In addition, as always, many improvements have been made.</p>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Software Architecture\n<p>The software architecture of imc Express has been improved even further. Why should this interest you as a user? Quite simple: the processing of your content is now faster and from now on imc is able to add new features to imc Express in even shorter intervals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Improvement of the "Content Element Video"\n<p>The content element "Video" has undergone a major update. If you use videos with subtitles in your project, you will now benefit from the synchronized display of the video and its subtitles. While the video is playing, the subtitle area always highlights the currently spoken text. Conversely, you can click in the subtitle area to jump directly to the corresponding part of the video. This makes editing video subtitles really easy!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>',
